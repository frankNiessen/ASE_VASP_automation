# DFT automatization using VASP and ASE
This repo contains a library that aims at automatizing some Density Functional Theory (DFT) workflows in [**VASP**](https://vasp.at/) by using the [**ASE**](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/index.html) toolkit. The workflows are adapted from the wonderful ressources provided by [Prof. John Kitchin](http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/dft-book/dft.html). I am not an expert in DFT but I hope that these scripts might be helpful to some people starting up with DFT and management of DFT workflows.

## Installation
- You need to have a properly working and licensed **VASP** installation on your local computer or a high performance cluster.
- You need to have **ASE** properly installed and set up to work with VASP (check out the instructions [here](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/calculators/vasp.html)). The workflow has been tested with version *3.20.1*.

## Structure
The repo consists of two scripts and a function library. The script *create_atoms.py* creates a structure and determines the number of bands and cores that should be allocated for a calculation. The script *job.py* describes the details of a job, which is a workflow consisting of several consecutive minimization procedures. In the example, some convergence tests and minimization procedures are performed on a Copper structure.

## Scripts
### create_atoms.py
This script is used to create/load a structure and determine the number of bands and cores for a calculation based on some common formulae. This is useful to estimate the parallelization options when optimizing large super-cells. Created structures are saved to and loaded from the subfolder *áº¡toms*.

### job.py
The job script shows an example workflow on a Copper structure. Here the parameters *e-cut* and *kpoints* are determined by convergence testing. Then the structure is optimized with different conditions for structure relaxation. All results are saved in a subfolder *results* which is created upon the first execution of the program. The results contain the raw input and output files from **VASP** as well as the results from convergence and optimization runs in the form of ASCII files and images of the plots.

## Parallelization
The scripts can be run as-is on a personal computer, by default it will do so with *kpar = 1* and *ncore = 1*. If you have **VASP** and **ASE** installed on a High Performance Cluster (*HPC*), or if you have a parallelized version of **VASP** compiled on your personal computer, you can supply the arguments *kpar* and *ncore* on the command line. As an example, you can run the calculations with *kpar = 2* and *ncore = 16* by executing: 
*job.py 2 16*

If you want to run **VASP** in a parallel environment, you will have to set the **ASE** environment variable *ASE_VASP_COMMAND* to *"mpirun vasp_std"*.
